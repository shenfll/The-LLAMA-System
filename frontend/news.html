      <h3 class="header">Town of Clifton Park Arbor Day</h3>
      <p class="text">On Saturday, April 24, 2021 the Town of Clifton Park held kick-off celebrations for a week long event to celebrate Earth Day and  Arbor Day. Our team was invited to promote the LLAMA Challenge. The event was held at the Clifton Commons. We went, had fun, and explained the LLAMA Challenge and our solution to others. We passed out flyers and had people scan the QR code for the Clifton Commons locations so they were on their way to completing the LLAMA Challenge.</p>
